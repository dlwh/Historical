1) PosUnigrams. Really really slow. Need help with logadds and such. Maybe scaling(?)
2) It's essential to do a "baby-steps" approach:
   Add in Spanish, then Italian, then Portuguese, then Latin. (or whatever)

    >> Really fast way to get a good initialization

   Otherwise, there's an attraction for Italian to go to whatever
   Latin is, and Portuguese to go to whatever Spanish is, and there's
   not enough forcing the others to go anywhere.
3) Parallelized to run on N cores. Embarrassingly parallel

4) Metrics:
  Pairwise accuracy, will add in "full accuracy" soon.

5) Likelihoods are wrong. Not sure if it's because of the message compressions, or some other bug.
